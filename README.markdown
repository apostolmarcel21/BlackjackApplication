# Blackjack Application

This application represents an exercise of using Java OOP concepts.
It simulates a *Blackjack* game between a _user player_ and _the computer_.

The scope of the game is to get closer to 21 than the opponent, without getting over 21.
The cards take values between 1 and 11.
At the beginning, each player receives 2 cards. One of the computer's cards is hidden and the player must take the first decision, _hold_ or _deal_ another card.
The player can receive one card at a time until he decides to stop.
If the player reaches 21, he will be the winner. Otherwise, the computer plays until it exceeds the score of the player or it passes 21.

Here are a few screenshots from the application usage:
